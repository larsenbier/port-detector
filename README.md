# port-detector
Progress made towards implementing a vision-based model for detecting empty and connected ports on server racks.

# File Info
* Note that all of these notebooks were originally written in Kaggle, so file references in the code refer to files in the `/kaggle/input` directory or the `/kaggle/working` directory.

## `port-dataset-for-classificiation.ipynb`
* Notebook used to transform the original dataset, which was in COCO json format, into a usable format.
* The generated dataset is used for classification, not object detection like the original dataset.
* The classification images were generated by taking sub-images of the original dataset (which was labeled with boxes identifying empty and connected ports).
* The output is generated as a zip file.

## `port-classifier.ipynb`
* This is the notebook used to train the image classifier used in the sliding window method of the `port-detector.ipynb`.

## `port-detector.ipynb`
* Notebook used to run the sliding window object detection method with the classifier from `port-classifier.ipynb`.
